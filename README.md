Welcome to Unity System Development
This is a personal project designed to refactor many common Unity Systems that have been compiled, via tutorial, wiki, or forum, and create an integrated system to link their functionality
Most of this will be through the built in Unity Event System, which allows method calls to be assigned in editor
